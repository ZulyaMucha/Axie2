# Axie

This is GitHub Repository For Subgraph Axie (https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/heghehog/axie)
If you are not familiar with Graph I highly recommend checking out these links:

This subgraph is not as good as it could be, because i am not a programmer and 
it is my first time working with any coding. With subgraphs  you can indexing
and querying data from blockchains, starting with Ethereum. It makes it possible 
to query data that is difficult to query directly.

This Subgraph tracks creating and transferring Axies (nft tokens in AxieInfinity game)
